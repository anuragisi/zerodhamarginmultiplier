It will extract the multiplier data which is essential for placing orders with right margin and 
so on it will help us all in getting right information in time.

As you can the text file "margin.txt" is where i dumped all our required output.

Now,it is only for equity and hope so later on ,we will commit the remaining parts.

If you need need serial number like numbering written before the stocks names.
For example: 1 3MINDIA:EQ 1x 3x

It depends upon user requirement ,if you need then you just have to change the values in line number 15 and 21 to range(0,4).
Then it is done.
Now you will be having the serial numbers with just before the stock name.

And finally you can use the text file whenever you require pull the data of CNC or MIS.
